# Hylean Cookbook

## _Work in progress_

Upload screenshots of your material inventory so you can easily see what recipes are available to you. This tool supports both docked mode (1080p) and tablet mode (720p). Try it out [over here](https://0x213f.github.io/hylean-cookbook/).

This is only tested on the original Switch in docked mode.

## Getting the application up and running

Locally you will have to run a web server (due to CORS). Easiest way to do that (assuming you have Python 3 installed on your machine) is with the following command:

```
python -m http.server 3000
```
